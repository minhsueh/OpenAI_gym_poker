00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.689
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So in this video, I'm going to show you how to generate novelty.

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.020
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So here's the execute file. Let me break it down for you.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.540
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So in the 1st portion you are going to import the config file with the config Yama, which is

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.790
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the Yama file you copied earlier.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.530
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and then you will generate the original environment with this config file.

6
00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:33.440
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So here we will have the base environment.

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.639
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And then you are going to initiate a novelty generator.

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.530
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So now the generator will take in the original environment

9
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.039
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and with the novelty list, so it can multiply environments and then return the multiplying environments back.

10
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.770
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So that is where we can get the novel environment.

11
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.050
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And you can see here will be the support the current supporting novelty.

12
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and I already put them in a config file.

13
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.250
Min-Hsueh Chiu: so

14
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.879
Min-Hsueh Chiu: as you can see that this is one of the novelty.

15
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:31.060
Min-Hsueh Chiu: But some of novelty might have argument inside. So, for example, in this card distribution color, we'll have arguments that it prohibits the red color occur

16
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.290
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right? So if we execute, so you can see that only black color card occur.

17
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.399
Min-Hsueh Chiu: But let's see

18
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.199
Min-Hsueh Chiu: if I want to prohibit black color.

19
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.499
Min-Hsueh Chiu: There we go, so everything, every every card is red color here. So that is how you can customize your novelty

20
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.489
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and for whom? Want to look into

21
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.680
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the novelty

22
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.810
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and novelty generator.

23
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.009
Min-Hsueh Chiu: You can go into the report.

24
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.870
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So

25
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.119
Min-Hsueh Chiu: in the poker utility

26
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.250
Min-Hsueh Chiu: folder.

27
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.229
Min-Hsueh Chiu: you can see that here is the existing novelty

28
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.309
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and novelty generator will be here, so you might want to look into here. If you want to make some modification.
