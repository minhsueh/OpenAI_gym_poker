00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:19.120
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay. So in the last video, I show you how to execute poker out. And in this video I'll show you a little advanced about execution and how we analyze the the result. So let us have a closer look

2
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.350
Min-Hsueh Chiu: about executes file.

3
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.299
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So in this script you can see users should manually

4
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.969
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to input their action. Right?

5
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:50.140
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So basically, what I'm saying is, you have to put your action in a in the command line, and then it will it will perform the the action. But what you can do is, let's say.

6
00:00:50.751 --> 00:01:04.559
Min-Hsueh Chiu: I want to let it automatically running. So in this. In this code, you can see, I just randomly choose whatever action is loud.

7
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.630
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So

8
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.842
Min-Hsueh Chiu: you can see that

9
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.210
Min-Hsueh Chiu: basically it will run the the game will continue running itself.

10
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.780
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay. So in this way you can create your own you can create your own.

11
00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:27.090
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Strategy. And then putting in program.

12
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.210
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so let me put it back again.

13
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:41.229
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So right now let me show you, how are we going to analyze the result? So there's 2 way the 1st way is

14
00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:58.949
Min-Hsueh Chiu: you can directly record the information here for for so, for example, in every step you have the observation, you have the reward you have. Is. It's terminates, and the information so you can record here by yourself.

15
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.015
Min-Hsueh Chiu: or

16
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.529
Min-Hsueh Chiu: we have put in law.

17
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.889
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So you can see

18
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.068
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here will be the

19
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.690
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the every step in a in a game.

20
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:30.019
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So, for example, let's say, everything is initialized, and there's a cash right? And the dealer, dollar dealer card, so you can see this will be the card for every player, and then

21
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.380
Min-Hsueh Chiu: whatever the player make a move, and it will be record.

22
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.879
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So this is the second way.

23
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:51.220
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And how are we going to change? The file name. So in the config file, you can see, here is the log file path, so you can do it manually.

24
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.570
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let's me

25
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.120
Min-Hsueh Chiu: delete it.

26
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.170
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And so you can see

27
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.770
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here. So here's the new generate test test log right?

28
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.250
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And it is consistent with the current state.

29
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.049
Min-Hsueh Chiu: But let's say, I want to

30
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.449
Min-Hsueh Chiu: make a move.

31
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.650
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so

32
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.980
Min-Hsueh Chiu: now this

33
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.780
Min-Hsueh Chiu: make a move right now

34
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.050
Min-Hsueh Chiu: let me put race beat here.

35
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.900
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Oops. Sorry.

36
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.810
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay.

37
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.339
Min-Hsueh Chiu: let me put.

38
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:54.590
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And you can see the new action is logging log into this Doc file. So that is how you you can make your own strategy. And also you can analyze the data here.
