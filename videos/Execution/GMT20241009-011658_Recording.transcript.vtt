00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.849
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay? So then demonstrate how I will use poker out.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.889
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So there's 2 type of user. One is general user. And I put some of learning instruction on remit

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.010
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and another one will be developer. There's also instruction for this.

4
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.690
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And so

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.710
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here I just demonstrate how general User can use.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.730
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So as you can see, here's my local command line, and this is the corresponding fold post folder.

7
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.870
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Right? This is a download poker out. So what I need to do is just follow

8
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.659
Min-Hsueh Chiu: follow the instruction. So let me just do it right now.

9
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.989
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So 1st of all, let us. Create a

10
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.499
Min-Hsueh Chiu: virtual environment, which is a good practice.

11
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.719
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and then I will install. Broker. All

12
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.720
Min-Hsueh Chiu: okay, cool. So right. Now let me generate the execution file.

13
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.020
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So, as you can see.

14
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.800
Min-Hsueh Chiu: there's an empty file here.

15
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.610
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.690
Min-Hsueh Chiu: but I need to do

17
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.210
Min-Hsueh Chiu: is to copy

18
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.859
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the following execution, file here

19
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.340
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and save

20
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.090
Min-Hsueh Chiu: okay?

21
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.530
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And the other one will be

22
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.800
Min-Hsueh Chiu: generate config file.

23
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.900
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Similarly.

24
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.280
Min-Hsueh Chiu: copy

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.469
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to config camera file.

26
00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:50.870
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so

27
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.130
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and comment

28
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.979
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this one. So this will have no novelty. Generate

29
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.350
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here.

30
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.840
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay? And

31
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.770
Min-Hsueh Chiu: finally

32
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.770
Min-Hsueh Chiu: execute it.

33
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:12.829
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So this might take a bit longer for the 1st time running.

34
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.809
Min-Hsueh Chiu: But I think it will be

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.450
Min-Hsueh Chiu: person.

36
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.450
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay.

37
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.790
Min-Hsueh Chiu: here we go.

38
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.419
Min-Hsueh Chiu: so as you can see

39
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.400
Min-Hsueh Chiu: that here's the border.

40
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.389
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Let me see

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.730
Min-Hsueh Chiu: soon.

42
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.280
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, here's the board, and here's the allowable

43
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.930
Min-Hsueh Chiu: execute

44
00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:39.839
Min-Hsueh Chiu: action. So let me execute

45
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.480
Min-Hsueh Chiu: raw speed.

46
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.129
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and the corresponding

47
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.850
Min-Hsueh Chiu: action

48
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.219
Min-Hsueh Chiu: will be performed

49
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.339
Min-Hsueh Chiu: all the way to your next move.

50
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.049
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Right? So this is the basic use case.

51
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.200
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so how about we are going to generate an inject novelty.

52
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.339
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me open up our configuration.

53
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.491
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So before that, there's some

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.849
Min-Hsueh Chiu: There are some customized parameter. So, for example, this visualize debug mode

55
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.820
Min-Hsueh Chiu: that I can see

56
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.290
Min-Hsueh Chiu: every player's card

57
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.230
Min-Hsueh Chiu: okay.

58
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.610
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and

59
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.049
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the other parameter here

60
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.719
Min-Hsueh Chiu: is allowing you

61
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.849
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to face forward

62
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.599
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to your next move.

63
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.709
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So you don't need to wait for other

64
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.559
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to take action.

65
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.230
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay.

66
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.840
Min-Hsueh Chiu: so

67
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.360
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this one will be the original

68
00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:55.740
Min-Hsueh Chiu: environment. So let me choose one of the environments. Let me

69
00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:58.560
Min-Hsueh Chiu: uncommon

70
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.150
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this one.

71
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.000
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay? So right now, supposedly. I will generate card distribution color, this novelty.

72
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.520
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So I think you are able to

73
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.810
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to find out what novelty it is.

74
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.870
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Right?

75
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.590
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So, as you can see

76
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.480
Min-Hsueh Chiu: that it is all black color card.

77
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.504
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So that is how I will.

78
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.549
Min-Hsueh Chiu: I would I would use

79
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.534
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this.

80
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.500
Min-Hsueh Chiu: yeah, this is how I will use the poke around.
