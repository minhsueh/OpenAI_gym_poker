00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.160
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me walk you through. Poke all architecture.

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.167
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So inside the gene open poker you can see here is the top in it. So

3
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.320
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this project is built on geneticism, and it is a standard api for reinforcement learning.

4
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.710
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So this top layer is the configuration for the generalism

5
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.860
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and inside the environment. This is the main poker environment.

6
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.130
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So you can see, here is a June poker

7
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.399
Min-Hsueh Chiu: ajin openpoker.py.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.620
Min-Hsueh Chiu: this is the main flow, main-came flow and the visualization.

9
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.269
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So in an image

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.840
Min-Hsueh Chiu: you can see it is

11
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.599
Min-Hsueh Chiu: card visualization.

12
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.549
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And here is the Oaker utility.

13
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:06.200
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So let me simulate the game playing, so you can map into the different object and functionality inside this folder.

14
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.609
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So, for example, I'm a player. So there's a player object

15
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.139
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right? And I'm going to sit at the table.

16
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.179
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So here is the board

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.600
Min-Hsueh Chiu: which contain board information

18
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.055
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and

19
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:36.340
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and so there's another player are going sit at a table as well. Right? So here we have the agent folder, and this 6 type of background agent will play with you.

20
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.640
Min-Hsueh Chiu: Okay, so this will be the background agent.

21
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:55.579
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and then once everybody sit down. Right? Then the game start. So there's a initialized game element. For example, player object can get buying amount of money

22
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.570
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right? And after initialized game element, the dealer.

23
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.229
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So here's the dealer.

24
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.160
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right dealer are going to tilt the car.

25
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.739
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So there's a card in card object here.

26
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.910
Min-Hsueh Chiu: and after dealer, build the card

27
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.810
Min-Hsueh Chiu: player are going to perform action.

28
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.220
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So here is one is the action state, the other one will be the action function

29
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.040
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right?

30
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.209
Min-Hsueh Chiu: And after everybody betting.

31
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.749
Min-Hsueh Chiu: then the dealer are going to change phase

32
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.300
Min-Hsueh Chiu: to from preflop to flaw

33
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.969
Min-Hsueh Chiu: right and then can continue.

34
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.980
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So. I think this pretty much cover? Every object and functionality in this folder.

35
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.150
Min-Hsueh Chiu: But there's another very important thing. Here will be a novelty generator. Right? So here's a novelty generator. And this novelty generator are

36
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.319
Min-Hsueh Chiu: the functionality that can generate can can inject novelty

37
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.730
Min-Hsueh Chiu: before

38
00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:13.870
Min-Hsueh Chiu: before the game started. Right? So this of the generator are going to use

39
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.909
Min-Hsueh Chiu: list of can can use this of learning novelties.

40
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.443
Min-Hsueh Chiu: So this is pretty much

41
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.630
Min-Hsueh Chiu: The architecture in the poker hall.
