Limit Betting Rules
Many poker games, like stud variants, are almost always played with limit (aka fixed-limit) betting rules. Any poker game can be played with a limit betting structure, however.

A Limit Texas Hold'em game played at $2/$4 limits generally means the blinds are $1/$2. Limit games are played with a "small bet" and a "big bet", with the big blind usually equal to the small bet.

Many limit games use a structure where the maximum raise is equal to the small bet in the early betting rounds and increases to the big bet amount in later betting rounds. In each round, the betting is "capped" after three raises, and subsequent players can only call after that.






Limit Hold'em Hand Example
For example, you're playing a $2/$4 Limit Texas Hold'em game and sit in the under-the-gun position. You're the first to act preflop, and you have the option to either call the $2 big blind or raise to a maximum of $4. You choose to call.

The player in the cutoff announces "raise", and can raise to a maximum of $4 total. The button raises to $6 (again the maximum allowed raise), and the big blind raises to $8, adding $6 to the $2 they've already committed to the pot.

As the under-the-gun player, you now have the option to call the $8 raise, which requires putting $6 more in the pot. You can also fold, but you can't raise any further.

You decide to call, the cutoff calls, and the button calls. The four live players now go to the flop betting round, with $33 total in the pot.

This same pattern of a maximum bet/raise of $2, capped at $8, applies for the flop betting round. For the turn and river betting rounds, the maximum bet/raise goes up to $4, capped at $16.
